# Fall2019
Repo for fall project "Differential mutability of human genome regions".
Aims of the project are using data on allele frequencies in different human populations:
1. Assess the susceptibility of various genomic regions to mutations;
2. See what factors determine it.
Tasks of the project:
1. The selection of data from the project 1000 genomes.
2. Calculate the local mutation frequency in a 1 Mb window using the site-frequency spectrum of neutral variations.
3. Watch the overlap of our data with the data of the repeting and binding sites with histones from TableBrowser.
4. Find main determinants of the local mutation frequency.
During this work Python and R were used.
